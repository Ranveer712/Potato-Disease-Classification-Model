# Potato Plant Disease Classification using CNN
This project aims to accurately classify potato plants into three categories: early blight, late blight, and healthy. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed, leveraging deep learning techniques, Python, and popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The model's accurate classification can aid in plant disease diagnosis and contribute to effective crop management strategies.

# Features
1.CNN Model: The project utilizes a CNN architecture to classify potato plants into early blight, late blight, and healthy categories. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks, as they can effectively extract relevant features from visual data.

2.Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: Extensive data preprocessing techniques are employed to enhance the quality and diversity of the potato plant image dataset. This includes resizing, normalization, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. These techniques improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen examples.

3.Training and Optimization: The CNN model is trained on a large-scale dataset, and key parameters are optimized to achieve exceptional classification accuracy. Techniques like transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained models such as VGG16 or ResNet, can also be employed to improve classification performance.

# Getting Started
To use the Potato Plant Disease Classification project, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

Ensure that Python is installed on your system, along with the required libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Pandas.

Preprocess the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques to enhance diversity.

Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques to achieve the desired accuracy.

Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. Make adjustments if necessary.

Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed for classifying potato plants into early blight, late blight, and healthy categories.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of potato plant images categorized into early blight, late blight, and healthy classes. The dataset should be preprocessed and organized into appropriate directories (train, validation, test) before training the model.
